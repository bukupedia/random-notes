This is a personal weblog.

This blog exists as a place to document anything worth remembering &dash; thoughts, notes, ideas, experiments, observations, etc.

There is no fixed topic and no intended audience. This is simply a record, written for clarity, personal reference and future use.

Nothing is curated. Nothing is optimized.  
Just logged, as it is.
